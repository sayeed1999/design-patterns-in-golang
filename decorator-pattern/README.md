# Decorator Pattern

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

## Similarity with Proxy Pattern

Both Proxy & Decorator might seem similar, but Proxy can only forward requests.
But decorator might add or remove behavior.

E.g if there are 3 methods in the main class, proxy class must also implement the exact 03.
But a decorator class can contain 5 or 6 methods or even 2 based on need.
